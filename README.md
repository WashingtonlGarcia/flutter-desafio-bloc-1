## :rocket: About
Consume an Api Rest using BLoC, REPOSITORY/DATASOURCE:
```
https://www.intoxianime.com/?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts&page=1&per_page=10
```
- page: This variable can go from 1 to 100 and represents the amount of items that the api will bring.
- per_page: Number of items per page.

Rules:

- Use BLoC pattern.
- Use default repository with Datasource.
- Use the infinite list (when you reach the end, load more items).
- Does not violate SOLID principles.
- No specific architecture is required.
